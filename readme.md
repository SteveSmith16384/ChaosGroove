# Chaos Groove
------------

By Richard Phipps

Chaos Groove is a remake by Richard Phipps of the classic Spectrum game Chaos: Battle of the Wizards.

Complied with MSVC 8.0 Express as a C++ project and uses the free demo version of PTK.
The project files included have some old references to another project, but should hopefully not cause any problems.
